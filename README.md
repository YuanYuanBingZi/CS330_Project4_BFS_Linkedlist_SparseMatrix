# CS330_Project4_BFS_Linkedlist_SparseMatrix
This project implements the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm using two approaches: a linked-list-based adjacency list and sparse matrix-vector multiplication. It includes functions for matrix manipulation, graph traversal, and result saving. Written in C, tested on provided graph datasets, and follows a modular and extensible design.
